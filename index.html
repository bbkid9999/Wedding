  <p> Love is what I see you as,<br> As red as a Ruby Rose,<br>Who stole a heart of innocent blue,<br>Then turned it into gold,<br>Bright shining as the stars above,<br>It Glitters just for you.<br><br>No more Roses are Red, Violets are Blue,<br>Cliches are so not cool,<br>This Valentine's Day it's easy to say,<br>I want to marry you someday.<br><br>So dear Ruby Rose its Glittering Gold,<br>Who thanks you for stealing me away,<br>My heart knew not what a light could do,<br>Until I first met you.<br><br>With that concludes a promise to you,<br>That Glittering Gold is a heart to hold a rose that only you.</p>
